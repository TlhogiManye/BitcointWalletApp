### Bitcoin Wallet App - README

#### Overview:

Welcome to the Bitcoin Wallet App â€“ an Android application designed to provide users with real-time information on Bitcoin conversion rates and fluctuations. This app allows users to convert Bitcoin amounts into various currencies, track currency trends, and efficiently manage their financial transactions.

#### Features:

- **Currency Conversion:** Convert Bitcoin amounts into different currencies.
- **Real-time Rates:** Stay updated with real-time currency conversion rates.
- **Fluctuation Tracking:** Monitor fluctuations in currency values over time.
- **Secure Transactions:** Implementing encryption for secure data handling.
- **User Preferences:** Utilize local storage for storing user preferences securely.

#### Architecture:

The app follows a modular MVVM architecture, adhering to SOLID principles for code maintainability and scalability. Key components include:

- **ViewModel:** Manages UI-related data, API calls, encryption, and local storage.
- **Repository Pattern:** Separates data access logic, providing a clean interface for API communication.
- **Encryption:** Utilizes AES algorithm for securing sensitive data.
- **Persistence:** Implements local storage using SharedPreferences with encrypted data storage.

#### Getting Started:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/bitcoin-wallet-app.git
   ```

2. **Build and Run:**
   Open the project in Android Studio, build, and run on an Android device or emulator.

3. **API Key:**
   Obtain an API key from [API Provider](https://api.apilayer.com/fixer/) and replace it in the `build.gradle` file.

#### Security Measures:

The application prioritizes security with measures including encryption for sensitive data, secure API communication, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

#### Future Improvements:

Areas for future enhancements include user authentication, transaction history, real-time updates, and additional security features.
